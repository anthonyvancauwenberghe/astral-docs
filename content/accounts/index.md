## Add Existing Account
Before you are able to launch a bot you first need to add your runescape account.
Click on add account and fill in your login credentials and bankpin if you have one. Our application will resolve all other data (ingame name, membership, etc) from the game itself so you don't need to worry about that.

## Create New Account
We are also able to automatically create an account for you. Click on the create account button and it will automatically create a new account for you and give you the credentials.
