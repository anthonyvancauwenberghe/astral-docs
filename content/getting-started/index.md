Next, if you haven't done yet create a new astral account otherwise fill in your credentials to launch the application.

## Add RS Account
Before you are able to launch a bot you first need to add your runescape account.
Click on add account and fill in your login credentials and bankpin if you have one. Our application will resolve all other data (ingame name, membership, etc) from the game itself so you don't need to worry about that.

At the machine panel you can click add a bot. A new view will open where you will be able to select a script, proxy, activity and other options related to the bot client (for more info click [here](/bots)). When you are finished click save.

## Launch Bot
Click the Launch button to start botting!
