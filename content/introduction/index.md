## What is Astral?

Astral is a runescape cloud based botting application that allows you to manage all your bots on multiple machines. It's written in kotlin and uses the latest technologies & services to provide you the best user experience possible.

## Why Astral?

Astral is the next generation runescape bot.
It allows you to manage all your bots from one control panel through the cloud, even though they are running on multiple machines, while at the same time reducing the memory and cpu usage to the bare minimum.
Supported by the latest technologies.

## Features

- 100% Cloud based. Control all your machines and bots from our website, track progress, view status, etc.

- Antiban algorithms through cloud data analysis.
The data we gather from all the bots is processed by our neural network to continiously improve banrates by randomizing walking patterns, mouse movements, mouse clicks, delays, etc.

- Cross Platform. Astral is written in Kotlin and is therefore multiplatform. You can run our application on the operating system of your choosing (windows, mac, linux).

- Mobile Apps (Ios/Android). Control your bots even when you are on the road.

- Automated muling. You never need to worry about having too much value on an account anymore! Our system will transfer the items to a safe mule for you.

- Extremely fast & lightweight. The client is written in kotlin java and was build with performance in mind,
each client uses around 200mb of ram and with our performance mode enabled around 1% cpu (quadcore clocked at 3.2 ghz),
allowing you to run a dazzling amount of bots on a single machine.

- Proxy support. You can add proxies and assign them to one or multiple bots to avoid chainbans.

- Intuitive design & low learning curve. Our Web & Mobile applications were specifically designed to give users the best experience possible.
